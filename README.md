# JavaScript React Gestalt Calculator
A CodeSandbox.io App that functions as a regular calculator created with React Javascript and Pinterest Open Sourced Gestalt UI components.

The template used from CodeSandbox.io was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Public Webpage: [JavaScript React Gestalt Calculator](https://71192wyq41.codesandbox.io)
